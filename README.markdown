[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/diagrams/docutils.png)](http://travis-ci.org/diagrams/docutils)

Utilities for working with XML output by the python
[docutils suite](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/).  The original
intention was for it to be a generic set of tools for interfacing
between Haskell and docutils, but it's not there yet.  Currently, it
is only used for building the user manual for the
[diagrams framework](http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams/).
